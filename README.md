# Introduction
### Motivation
Vim is a great, lightweight text editor that can be accessed from your terminal and is even better when combined with Tmux(Terminal Multiplexer).
It has a steep learning curve but the payoff in increased efficiency is worth it.
In my opinion, you only require a small subset of Vim knowledge to use it effectively. Conforming to the 90-10 principle.
90% of the time you will be only using 10% of the available Vim functionality.
So even if Vim has a high learning curve you only need the basics to use it like a pro. Learning all the bells-and-whistles Vim has to offer
is where the learning curve picks up, but honestly that's were the fun is.
This guide will mainly cover the basics and some nifty bells-and-whistles.

### Modes
The first time you load up Vim, you won't be able to type in any text in. This is often the most off-putting feature for most new users.
You can't even do something simple like typing in text, worst of all you can't even exit Vim, without Vim's close command which is ":q".
This is because Vim is in normal mode. What is a mode? What is normal mode? Why does it have to be so complicated?
What is a mode?
The way I see mode is a different keyboard. This is were Vim has a lot of potential because many different shortcuts are mapped to different
key combinations. You should be familiar with Crtl-C and Crtl-V or CMD-C and CMD-V. Vim in essence has a shortcut for everything imaginable.
To fit all these commands onto a keyboard, you have different modes. When you are in a different mode, your keyboard has access to a different
set of shortcuts.
